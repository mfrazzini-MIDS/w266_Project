## W266 NLP and Deep Learning Project
## Abstract
Product features, along with customer sentiment for those features, are highly desirable to specialty e-commerce retailers so they may provide expertise and value to customers in the areas of product development and curation, shopping search and discovery, personalized recommendations, and effective and efficient marketing. Success in these areas drive retail sales, growth, and customer loyalty in a highly competitive e-commerce marketplace. Written product reviews provided by customers are an authentic and rich source of valuable features and sentiment, but extracting and refining valuable information from reviews is difficult. The goal is to extract product features from raw customer reviews, and attempt to discern customer sentiment for the specific product features. The approach to achieving this goal combines NLP data cleansing and text processing, subjectivity/objectivity partitioning, parts-of-speech (POS) tagging, and sentiment classification using deep learning with minimal supervision to lessen the need for costly and time consuming data labeling.
